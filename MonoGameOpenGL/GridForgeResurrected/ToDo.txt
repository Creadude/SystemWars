Grid Forge

Action schmup with some additional elements of rpg, rogue likes, base building.

First port of call is to develop simple, fun, top down twin-stick mechanics.

- arena with some walls.
- controllable cube with slightly slidy physics. Move and aim with M+K or controller. Collides with walls.
- shooting. Projectiles collide sensibly.
