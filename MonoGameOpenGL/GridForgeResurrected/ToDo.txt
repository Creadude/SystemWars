Grid Forge

Action schmup with some additional elements of rpg, rogue likes, base building.

First port of call is to develop simple, fun, top down twin-stick mechanics.


- shooting. Projectiles collide sensibly.
- some stuff to clarify
	- how do I detect entities near X or within volume Y?
- particles
- bloom
