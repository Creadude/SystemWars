- Figure out Carrier stuff
	- How to move it


What's the game here?


Could prototype something simpler?
	- Rescue Chopper!

Time based rescue challenge. Crazy taxi style.
	- Allows us to hone chopper controls, get fun physics. Do some UI.
	- Go for polish
	- You're a little chopper based on a ship off shore. 
	- You have to scoot around the island(s) doing the following:
		- Rescuing people (in the sea, on top of mountains etc)
		- Take them back to either your ship, or a local point of safety.

	- Winching supplies.
		- Some people need stuff. Stuff is lying about. Find and deliver it
	
	- Chopper has limited capacity.
